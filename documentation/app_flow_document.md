# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new visitor arrives at the application by navigating to the root URL in their browser, they first see a clean landing page that highlights the community’s photo feed and features an invitation to join or sign in. The landing page displays a hero section with sample images and a clear call to action to create an account or log in. Choosing to create an account brings up a sign-up form where users can enter their email address, pick a password, and confirm the password. Below the email sign-up form, buttons for signing up via social providers such as Google or GitHub are available, each opening the corresponding OAuth consent screen and returning the user to the app upon success. Once the user submits valid information, the system validates their input and triggers Supabase Auth to register the account. After registration, the user is automatically signed in and taken to the main dashboard. Returning users can click the “Sign In” link on the landing page to provide their email and password or to use the same social login options. If a user forgets their password, they can click a “Forgot Password” link which opens a recover password form. After entering their email, they receive a reset link by email, and once they follow that link and set a new password, they are returned to the sign-in page. Throughout the session, a persistent “Log Out” option is present in the header or profile menu so that signed-in users can end their session at any time.  

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user lands on the main dashboard, which is organized into a top navigation bar and a central content area. The navigation bar at the top contains links to the home feed, an “Upload Photo” button, a user avatar that opens a profile menu, and a theme toggle for switching between light and dark modes. In the central area, the user sees an infinitely scrolling grid of photos from all community members. Each image is displayed in a card with a thumbnail, the uploader’s avatar and name, and a brief title or description. As the user scrolls, new photos are fetched seamlessly in the background. While images load, animated placeholders appear to maintain smooth scrolling. Clicking the site logo in the top bar always returns the user to this home feed from anywhere in the app.  

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user wants to add a new photo, they click the “Upload Photo” button in the navigation bar. A modal dialog opens containing a form built with React Hook Form. Inside the form, the user selects an image file, views a preview, and enters the title, description, and optional tags. Pressing the “Submit” button triggers a mutation that first uploads the file to Supabase Storage and then creates a photo record in the Supabase database with the returned file URL and metadata. While the upload is in progress, the submit button shows a spinner and the modal prevents additional input. On success, the modal closes, a toast notification confirms the upload, and the feed is invalidated so the new photo appears at the top of the grid.  

Clicking any photo card in the feed navigates the user to a photo detail page at the route `/photos/:id`. This page displays the full-size image and its title, description, tags, and uploader information. Below the image, there is a like button with a live count and a comments section. Users can click the like button to toggle their like and see the count update immediately. Adding a comment is done by typing into a text area and hitting “Post.” Each new comment appears instantly thanks to real-time subscriptions via Supabase.  

When a user clicks on another member’s name or avatar, they are taken to that member’s profile page at `/users/:username`. The profile page shows the user’s display name, avatar, bio, and their personal photo gallery. Photos in this gallery appear in a grid similar to the home feed. If the visiting user clicks on one of those photos, they again see the standard photo detail view. Profile pages include an “Edit Profile” button for the profile owner that opens a form where they can update their avatar, display name, and bio. Saving these changes writes directly to the user’s Supabase profile record.  

Administrators or advanced users with elevated roles can access a dedicated admin panel at `/admin`. This panel includes pages to review reported photos or comments, manage user accounts, and delete or restore content. Navigating between the home feed, photo detail pages, user profiles, and the admin panel uses a consistent header or sidebar navigation so the user always knows where they are and how to go back.  

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage their account via the profile menu in the top navigation bar. Choosing “Account Settings” takes the user to a page where they can update their email address and change their password. If they update their email, they must confirm it by clicking a verification link sent to the new address. If they change their password, they must enter the current password and then the new password twice for confirmation. Below their account credentials, users can toggle notification preferences such as receiving emails when someone comments on their photo or follows them. Since this application does not support paid subscriptions at this stage, there is no billing section. When the user finishes adjusting settings, saving returns them to the same settings page with a success message. A link back to the home feed appears in the navigation bar and in a breadcrumb at the top of the settings page.  

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a user enters invalid credentials during sign-in, an error message appears above the form instructing them to check their email or password. During sign-up, if the email is already in use or the password fails strength requirements, inline validation errors explain the problem. In the photo upload form, selecting a non-image file or a file that is too large triggers a validation error before the upload begins. If the upload or record creation fails due to network issues, a toast alerts the user that something went wrong and they can retry. When navigating to a photo detail or profile URL that does not exist, the app displays a styled 404 page with a message that the content was not found and a button to return to the home feed. If the user loses internet connectivity, a banner alerts them that they are offline, and data-fetching operations pause until the connection is restored. Once back online, the banner disappears and any missed queries automatically refire.  

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a new visitor arrives at the landing page to the daily routine of browsing and sharing photos, the application guides users through a clear and engaging experience. They register or sign in using email or social OAuth, explore a lively photo feed on the dashboard, and quickly upload new images via a modal form. Each photo can be viewed in detail, liked, and commented on in real time. Users maintain their own profile pages and edit personal information in account settings, while administrators oversee the community through an admin panel. Robust error handling and responsive design ensure that users stay informed and uninterrupted even when data is invalid or connectivity is lost. This flow drives toward the typical goals of sharing creative work, discovering others’ photography, and building a community around visual storytelling.
